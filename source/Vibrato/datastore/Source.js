        Commits a set of creates/updates/destroys to the source. These are
        specified in a single object, which has record type names as keys and an
        object with create/update/destroy properties as values. Those properties
        have the following types:
        
        create  - `[ [ storeKeys... ], [ dataHashes... ] ]`
        update  - `[ [ storeKeys... ], [ dataHashes... ], [changedMap... ] ]`
        destroy - `[ [ storeKeys... ], [ ids... ] ]`
        
        Each subarray inside the 'create' array should be of the same length,
        with the store key at position 0 in the first array, for example,
        corresponding to the data hash at position 0 in the second. The same
        applies to the update and destroy arrays.
        
        A changedMap, is a map of attribute names to a boolean value indicating
        whether that value has actually changed. Any properties in the data has
        not in the changed map are presumed unchanged.
        
        The default implementation of this method considers each entry for a
        type. If that type has a handler defined in <O.Source#recordCommitters>,
        then this will be called with the create/update/destroy hash as the sole
        argument, otherwise it will look for separate handlers in
        <O.Source#recordCreators>, <O.Source#recordUpdaters> and
        <O.Source#recordDestroyers>.
        
        Any types that are handled by the source are removed from the changes
        object; any unhandled types are left behind, so the object may be passed
        to several sources, with each handling their own types.
        
        For example:
        
            source.commitChanges({
                MyType: {
                    create: [
                        [ 'sk1', 'sk2' ],
                        [ {attr: val, attr2: val2 ...}, {...} ]
                    ],
                    update: [
                        [ 'sk3', 'sk4' ],

        A map of type names to functions which will commit destroys for a
        particular record type. The function will be called with the source as
        'this' and will get the following arguments:
        
        storeKeys - {Array.<String>} A list of store keys.
        ids       - {Array.<String>} A list of the corresponding record ids.
        
        Once the request has been made, the following callbacks must be made to
        the <O.Store> instance as appropriate:
        
        * <O.Store#sourceDidCommitDestroy> if there are any commited destroys.
        * <O.Store#sourceDidNotDestroy> if there are any temporarily rejected
          updates.
        * <O.Store#sourceDidError> if there are any permanently rejected
          updates.
