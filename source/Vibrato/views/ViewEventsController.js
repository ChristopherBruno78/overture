/**
    Object: O.ViewEventsController

    Most DOM events are handled via delegation. When an event occurs, it is
    passed to the O.ViewEventsController. This maintains a list of event
    targets that should receive the event before the view handles it, and a list
    of targets that should receive it after it has traversed the view hierarchy.

    When an event is dispatched, it passes through all targets in the first
    list, then is dispatched at the view which owns the node on which the event
    occurred (and will bubble up the view tree from there), then passes through
    all the targets that are queued to handle it after the view. Any event
    handler may call `event.stopPropagation()`, which will stop the view from
    passing to any further targets.
