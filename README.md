Overture
========

Overture is a JavaScript library that contains all the tools you need to build a slick, modern web app. It was originally built to power [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com)'s awesome webmail.

To get started, check out the heavily commented Todo demo app in the `examples` folder, or use your browser web dev tools on the live demo at: <http://overturejs.com/examples/Todo/>.

You can find API documentation and download a pre-built copy of the library from <http://overturejs.com>.

Overture is MIT licensed. No animals were harmed in the making of this code.
